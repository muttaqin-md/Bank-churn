    "From the 2000 people in our test data, there are 407 customers who left the bank. Of those, our model captures 236. The confusion matrix indicates that, when the model makes an error, it’s usually a Type II error (171) — it gives a false negative by failing to predict that a customer will leave. On the other hand, it makes fewer Type I errors (140), which are false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, whether these results are acceptable depends on the costs of the measures taken to prevent a customer from leaving versus the value of retaining them. In this case, bank leaders may decide that they’d rather have more true positives, even if it means also capturing significantly more false positives. If so, perhaps optimizing the models based on their F1 scores is insufficient. Maybe we’d prioritize a different evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to modify the decision-making without retraining the model is to adjust the threshold at which the model predicts a positive response. In other words, the model determines a probability that a given customer will churn. By default, if that probability is ≥ 0.50, then the model will label that customer as churned. Probabilities of < 0.50 would designate a non-responder. But it's possible to adjust this decision threshold. For instance, if we set the threshold to 0.3, then the model would label customers with predicted probabilities ≥ 0.3 as churned, and those with probabilities < 0.3 as not churned. This would increase the recall of the model, but decrease the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, what is certain is that our model helps the bank. Consider the results if decision-makers had done nothing. In that case, they’d expect to lose 407 customers. Alternatively, they could give everybody an incentive to stay. That would cost the bank for each of the 2 000 customers in our test set. Finally, the bank could give incentives at random—say, by flipping a coin. Doing this would incentivize about the same number of true responders as our model selects. But the bank would lose a lot of money offering the incentives to people who aren’t likely to leave, and our model is very good at identifying these customers."
